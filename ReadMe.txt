SHOPPING CART WEBSITE
Website based on the service-oriented architecture (SOA).

Core Features of the website: 

1. High Availability -  Web or application server level: each service should be supported on at least 2 node instances. Database level: replicate the database on at least 2 node instances
2. High Performance: perform distributed caching. Memcached is a good option for implementing a distributed caching mechanism.
3. Scalability: perform database sharding. The database should be broken into at least 2 shards.
4. Client-Server Communication Encryption: encrypt the communication channel between the client and server using TLS/SSL
5. Request/Response Compression: perform compression (e.g. gzip) of the client request and server response
6. Authentication/Authorization: the website should be protected by a username/password or secret based service request authentication and authorization module.
7. Asynchronous Services: the supported services should be asynchronous. This can be implemented either using AJAX or performed using request/response queuing techniques.

- The project requires configuring server instances and database.
- The uploaded version of the project does not include all the features listed.
- I would soon upload the final version (neater version) of project along with the instructions for setting up server and database.

Thank you.
